# Lab Work Description

The goal of this lab work was to analyze referral links mentioned in a blogger's posts from 2022-2023 (or all time) to understand which advertising companies funded the blogger.

## Task Requirements

For this lab work, any blogger with accounts on YouTube, Vk, Telegram could be chosen (or three different bloggers, represented on the respective platforms). The solution architecture for collecting data from social networks and storing it in a database with the necessary pipelines was presented. The following data collection was required:

- Blogger account/channel link/subscriber count
- Blogger post with link in the social network/text description of the post
- Reactions of subscribers/users to the post (likes, views, dislikes, other emotions, number of comments)
- 100 comments

The lab work also required the presentation of the results for the following data:

- All referral links encountered during the analysis of the text description of the post
- Recognition of the referral link with the name of the domain owner company
- Visualization of results about companies supporting the blogger with an indication of the budget cost per advertising campaign.
- Overall, this lab work aimed to provide insights into the advertising companies that fund bloggers and the extent of their influence on the blogger's content.
